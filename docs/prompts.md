Here's a step-by-step process to prompt ChatGPT to help create a management system for the specification and implementation of OpenAPI function-calling endpoints:

### Step 1: Define the Objective

**Prompt:**
"I want to create a management system for the specification and implementation of OpenAPI function-calling endpoints. Can you guide me through the process?"

### Step 2: Specify the Key Components

**Prompt:**
"What are the key components I need to consider for this system?"

### Step 3: Designing the API Specification

**Prompt:**
"How do I design the API specification using Swagger (OpenAPI)? Please provide an example specification for a sample API."

### Step 4: Generating Server Stubs

**Prompt:**
"How can I generate server stubs from the OpenAPI specification? What tools should I use, and what are the commands?"

### Step 5: Implementing Business Logic

**Prompt:**
"After generating server stubs, how should I implement the business logic in the generated code?"

### Step 6: Creating Interactive Documentation

**Prompt:**
"How can I set up Swagger UI to provide interactive documentation for my API? What are the necessary steps and configurations?"

### Step 7: Setting Up Mock Servers

**Prompt:**
"How do I create mock servers using Swagger Mock to allow frontend developers to test the API? Can you provide an example setup?"

### Step 8: Enforcing Security Policies

**Prompt:**
"How do I define and enforce security policies in the OpenAPI specification? Can you show me how to implement these policies in the API?"

### Step 9: Integrating with CI/CD

**Prompt:**
"How can I integrate the OpenAPI specification and implementation with CI/CD pipelines? What are the best practices?"

### Step 10: Monitoring and Analytics

**Prompt:**
"What tools should I use for API monitoring and analytics? How do I set up these tools to track usage and performance?"
